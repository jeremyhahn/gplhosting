DNS services are powered by <a href="http://www.isc.org/index.pl?/sw/bind/" target="_blank">BIND DNS</a> server, and the mail services are powered by <a href="http://www.xmailserver.org" target="_blank">Xmail server</a>. Web services are being hosted by <a href="http://www.apache.org" target="_blank">Apache</a> 2.0 webserver on the <a href="http://www.linux.org/" target="_blank">linux</a> platform. </p>

                <p class="menu">The server hosting these services on our network is powered by Dual Athlon 2400+ MP processors, with 1GB of RAM. There are 3, 120GB hard drives which are configured as:</p>
                <p class="menu">/dev/hda = DNS / Mail<br>
                  /dev/hdb = MySQL Databases<br>
                  /dev/hdc = Web/FTP</p>
                <p class="menu">This server supports RAID, however, does not have enough storage space at this time to take advantage of. As the project grows, we are hoping to cure this using funds donated by project users, so that each service will have its own RAID-5 partition. </p>
                <p class="menu">The internet connection is currently being hosted on a cable service with 1 static IP address; bandwidth throughput is 3.0mb downstream and 386kb upstream. Plenty of room for donations here! </p></td>
