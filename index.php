                <p class="style3">Project GPL Hosting was launched to provide a free and educational hosting environment for its users. Project GPL Hosting is Open Source, which offers its community of users the chance to look under the hood and see what it takes to do some of the things which the network has to offer, as well as give others the offer of becoming a part of the GPL Hosting network. The network is and always will be 100% free to  its community of users, thanks to our contributors! </p>
                  <p class="style3">&nbsp;</p>
                  <p class="style3"><strong>What The Project Offers </strong></p>
                  <p class="style3">Project GPL Hosting currently offers DNS services for both static and dynamic users, standard POP3 mail hosting, MX-Backup mail services, port 25 deflection mail services, and web services with statistics, FTP access (with more to come!) all through an easy to manage hosting control panel. The source code which is used to make up the functionality of this website is freely available for download, which allows users to play around and get involved in a very interesting, functional, practical, and fun project! Project GPL Hosting offers everything you need to get started on the web with a new business, maintain an existing network, provide redundancy and failover solutions, or even create your own custom fabricated co-location network! Oh yea, one more thing, <span class="style5"> our hosting services here are free of charge!</span></p>
                  <p class="style3">&nbsp;</p>
                  <p class="style3"><strong>How Project GPL Hosting Got Started</strong></p>
                  <p class="style3">The world of Open Source is more than a 'community of users', but rather a move towards a more economical and practical way of computing. Many commercial software vendors try to lock you into their products any way they can, thanks to their marketing specialists, who really care only about pushing another product, rather than manufacturing software that allows its users to squeeze everything they can get from the product. Open Source on the other hand, is the most powerful software you can lay your hands on! Open Source code allows you to customize your applications any way you like, and best of all, most of the time, its free! Open Source software allows you the freedom and flexibility you need to put your business and talents into high gear!</p>
                  <p class="style3">Although Open Source is free to its users, it is not a rational thought to assume that a developer can design software 24/7  with no profit. Developers have bills too, and  things such as donations, commercial licences, paid support, or even freelance work contracted on the side, allows Open Source developers the funds they need to pay bills and continue producing the best software available to mankind!</p>
                  <p class="style3">&nbsp;</p>
                  <p class="style3"><strong>The Goal </strong></p>
                  <p class="style3">The goal of the project is to host an environment which will provide solutions to internet related network/development issues and also  allow other internet entrepenuers/newcomers the chance to get involved in helping their community while they learn and get involved with a very interesting and functional project. This project is being built upon a framework which is completely cross platform compatible, and completely modular, so that it can quickly adapt to a custom environment. Anyone who wants to get involved can download the source, and tie into the GPL Hosting network as a co-located partner, and become a redundant link. The project will eventually provide a 1-2-3 install on Microsoft or Unix/Linux, while maintaining a structured and integrated infrastructure which will span all 7 continents.</p>
                  <p class="style3">&nbsp;</p>
                  <p class="style3"><strong>What Strings Are Attached</strong></p>
                  <p class="style3">This network is used to advertise Project GPL Hosting affiliates and sponsors who contribute to the growth and future of this project. Project GPL Hosting is being released under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html" target="_blank">GNU General Public Licence Agreement</a>.

                  <p class="style3"><strong>How To Get Started In 2 Simple Steps </strong></p>
                  <p class="style3">To get started using the network, please use the sign-up link in the navigation bar above. </p>
                  <p class="style3"><strong>1) </strong>You will need to create a username and a password which you will use to access the hosting control panel. You will also set up a secret phrase which you will use to reset your password should you happen to forget it at a later time.</p>
                  <p class="style3"><strong>2)</strong> You will be sent a confirmation Email where you will need to click on a link to activate your account. Click on the link!</p>
                  <p class="style4">NOTE: Don't forget to make a donation to the project if you find it beneficial. This is a very expensive and time consuming project! At Project GPL Hosting, you define everything, including your service rates. Unfortunatley, without generous donations to aide in the cost of networking/development, this project can not be considered a stable and secure establishment. Get involved and support the worlds best FREE hosting network so we can guarantee it will be around to serve you for years to come!</p>
